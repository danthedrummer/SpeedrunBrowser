## Contributing

Feel free to open up pull requests on the repository but I have to ask that you follow a few simple rules

### Pull Requests

* Ensure that all tests are passing locally before creating the pull request
* Update documentation where necessary (Kdocs, README, etc.)
* Fill out the pull request template as fully as possible
* A repository owner will merge the changes once approved

### Standards

**Do**
* Stick to [Kotlin style guidelines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html) for code formatting
* Include documentation for all new classes and functions
* Update documentation for all modified code where appropriate
* Include tests for new code where appropriate
* Accept and provide helpful criticism

**Don't**
* Open pull requests just to change whitespace
* Include private credentials in pull requests
* Use inappropriate language
* Abuse other contributors
