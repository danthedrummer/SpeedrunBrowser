# SpeedrunBrowser

An android application built for my fourth year "Mobile Appliction Development" module.
The application lets the user browse the speedrum.com leaderboards and view world record speedruns for the various categories available.
Users can also request a random speedrun and they will be presented with a random game, category and leaderboard position run.

### Note

This app uses the Youtube Android Player and requires an API key to function. If you are cloning the repo you must provide your own key.
